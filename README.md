 Followed the tutorial over the course of two and a half hours to create this timer application. The things I found issue with right away were some glaring bugs, including every time you'd hit the "start" button you would speed up the timer and send it out of whack causing it to never end. Also the timer animation would reset after every pause. Was able to write another few lines of code to address a bit of this issue, however I'm not happy with the final product.
 
 I've decided I'm going to rework this application a bit and make it more aesthetically pleasing, while also eliminating any UI issues I come across.
